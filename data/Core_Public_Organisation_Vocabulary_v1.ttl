  dct:description "The Core Public Organization Vocabulary is designed to describe the organization itself. Whilst the vocabulary may support links to descriptions of public services, members of staff or other resources such as relevant legislation, policies and jurisdictional coverage, it will not describe those resources in detail. Public organizations involve elected representatives but these descriptions are out of scope for the current work but may be the focus of future work once the vocabulary is established and used."@en ;

<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel> a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "preferred label"@en ;
  vann:usageNote "As defined in the ORG Ontology, a preferred label is used to provide the primary, legally recognised name of the organization. An organization may only have one such name in any given language. Primary names may be provided in multiple languages with multiple instances of the preferred label property."@en .

<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel> a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "alternative label"@en ;
  vann:usageNote "In line with ORG and SKOS itself, an organization may have any number of alternative or informal names, irrespective of language."@en .

<http://www.w3.org/ns/org#identifier> a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "identifier"@en ;
  vann:usageNote "Many organizations are referred to by an acronym or some other identifier. For example, among the EU institutions, the ECB is the identifier for the European Central Bank, OLAF for the European Anti-Fraud Office, and so on. These are formally recognised by the European Commission which provides a list of such acronyms . Analogous lists should be used in other contexts."@en .

<http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> a rdf:Property ;

  vann:usageNote "This property provides a textual description of the organization."@en .
  
<http://purl.org/dc/terms/spatial> a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "spatial"@en ;
  vann:usageNote "This property links an organization to the administrative region(s) that it covers. The value of the properly should be the URI of the region as defined in an authoritative list of regions. In Europe, this is likely to be the Administrative Territorial Units  Named Authority List maintained by the Publications Office's Metadata Registry. The ATU list does not include a geometry. That is, the territory is only identified by its name not its spatial coordinates. This is likely to be the case for similar lists. If geometries are available for the Public Organization's territory, they can be linked from the territorial unit using the Location Core Vocabulary's locn:geometry property."@en .
  
<http://www.w3.org/ns/org#purpose> a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "purpose"@en ;
  vann:usageNote "This property links an organization to its function(s) which are expressed as a SKOS Concept Scheme. The ORG ontology suggests that this property can also be thought of as meaning 'remit' or 'responsibility.' Ideally this will link to a COFOG code but where this isn't possible or appropriate, other controlled vocabularies may be used."@en ;

<http://www.w3.org/ns/org#classification> a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "classification"@en ;
  vann:usageNote "This property links an organization to a SKOS Concept that provides a classification. As an example, the Publications Office of the European Union provides a Named Authority list of Organization Types  which is appropriate for European institutions. Other classification schemes should be used at other levels of public organization."@en .
  
<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage> a rdf:Property ;

<http://schema.org/logo> a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "logo"@en ;
  vann:usageNote "A property to link an organization to its logo. The value of this property can simply be the URL of the logo but it is better for developers if it links to an object that provides the URL of the image and essential metadata about it, notably its dimensions. In the RDF release of the CPOV, this property is bound to schema:logo which takes either a URL or a schema:ImageObject as its value."@en .

  rdfs:label "has SubOrganization"@en ;
  vann:usageNote "Public Organizations are often large and complex and may be a collection of smaller organizations, each of which has a specific identity that may be legally defined. The hasSubOrganization and subOrganizationOf properties express the relationships between organizations in a hierarchical structure. In contrast, hasUnit and unitOf are used to link to operational departments within an organization that may not generally exist in their own right. In the RDF release of the CPOV, hasSubOrganization is bound to org:hasSubOrganization and subOrganizationOf is bound to org:subOrganizationOf."@en .

  vann:usageNote "Organizations typically comprise many departments, units, teams etc. Each of these is modelled in the CPOV as a unit that is linked from the parent organization with hasUnit and to the parent with unitOf. An Organizational Unit is a sub class of Organization but conceptually does not exist in its own right. This is in contrast to a sub organization that, although part of the larger organization, may be legally distinct or otherwise enjoy a degree of autonomy."@en .

  vann:usageNote "One organization may be a member of another without being a sub organization, i.e. they are independent entities. These properties allow such relationships to be captured. The memberOf and hasMember properties are very simple and don't support statements describing the nature of the membership. The W3C Organization Ontology provides both this simple method and a more sophisticated model  that does make it possible to, for example, provide information about the period of time in which one organization was a member of another, the level of membership etc. That more sophisticated model should be used where necessary and may be used in addition to the simple memberOf/hasMember properties."@en .
